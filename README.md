Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

📌 Problem Statement
Customer segmentation involves dividing customers into different groups to better understand their behaviors. This helps businesses make data-driven decisions, such as targeted marketing and personalized offers, to improve customer experience and revenue.

Supervised Learning: Classification & Regression
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering (Used in this project)

📌 Workflow
1️⃣ Customer Data → 2️⃣ Preprocessing → 3️⃣ Data Analysis → 4️⃣ Finding Optimum Clusters → 5️⃣ K-Means Clustering → 6️⃣ Visualizing Clusters

📌 About the Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Features:
Customer ID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (in $1000s)
Spending Score (1-100, higher means more spending)



📌 Clusters Identified
Cluster	Color	Description
Cluster 1	🟢 Green	Balanced income and spending
Cluster 2	⚫ Black	High income, high spending (ideal customers)
Cluster 3	🟡 Yellow	High income, low spending (potential for marketing offers)
Cluster 4	🔵 Blue	Low income, low spending (budget-conscious customers)
Cluster 5	🟣 Purple	Moderate income, varying spending

🔹 Business Insight:
Offer discounts to Cluster 3 (High income, low spending) to encourage purchases.
Focus premium services on Cluster 2 (High income, high spending).


📌 Real-World Applications
E-commerce: Personalized product recommendations.
Retail: Targeted discount campaigns.
Netflix & OTT Platforms: Content recommendation based on viewing patterns.
Banking & Finance: Identifying high-value customers for premium services.
